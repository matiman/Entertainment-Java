Instructions on how to run the application:

- Clone the above project from dev branch to your local machine
- Make sure you have Java 17 installed on the machine you are running
- Assuming that you have IDEA, import the project as Gradle project
- Make sure you have mysql database running on your machine (this could be on a docker instance).
- If you have mysql installed on docker you can use the following command:
- #docker run -d -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -e MYSQL_DATABASE=mydb mysql:latest
- See application.yml file if you want to change setting before running
- I used auto: update so the database should be created automatically for the first time. 
- Then it appends afterwards when you restart your application.
- Build the project with gradle on Intelij and run the application
